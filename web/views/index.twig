     <ul>
         <p>This is my personal website that I can see my schedule and show the projects I have done in each course.
            When I want to confirm any information on moodle, I can access the link under this page to connect to moodle.
            After I finished any project, I will put them on this page as a record to show what I have done in each class.
            To motivate myself, there will be different goals for each course.
            The goals may be a project or a skill, depends on the course, my abilities, and professor's requests.</p></h3>
     </ul>
     <ul>
          <p>Following are the goals for each course:
          <ul><li>IS 601</li>
              I am not expecting to become a master after this course, I just want to have basic concept of website system, and try to build a website by myself.
              <li>IS 663</li>
              In this class, I will build up a system to solve a problem or make something more convenient. It might be
              an APP or a website. If it is a website, I will apply what I learn in course IS 601 and build a website.
              If it is an APP then I will learn something new about creating an APP.
              <li>IS 677</li>
              Students will have lots discussions in this course, my goal for this course would be changing idea
              with other students as much as I can in the course. Learning basic theory of Information System and
              exchange idea with classmates and professor to have some new ideas.
           </ul></p>
     </ul>
     <ul>
         <p>At the end of this semester, I will put the projects I have done on this website. Besides, I will make a summary to
             review what I have done in last few months and see what should I improve and prepare for next semester. I hope this website
             could be a recording and my profile.</p>
