        <p> This is my personal website that I can see my schedule and show the projects I have done in each course.
                When I want to confirm any information on moodle, I can access the link under this page to connect to moodle.
                After I finished any project, I will put them on this page as a record to show what I have done in each class.
                To motivate myself, there will be different goals for each course.
                The goals may be a project or a skill, depends on the course, my abilities, and professor's requests.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <p>Following are the goals for each course:
        <li>IS 601</li>
        I'm not expecting myself become a master after this course, I just hope I will have basic concept of website system, and try to build a website by myself.
        <li>IS 663</li>
        In this class, I will build up a system to solve a problem or make something more convenient. It might be an APP or a website. If it is a website, I will apply what I learn in course 601 to build a website.
        If it is an APP then I will learn something new about creating an APP.
        <li>IS 677</li>
        Students will have lots discussions in this course, the goal for this course would be changing idea
        with other students as much as I can in the course. To exchange idea and have some new concept of Information System.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>At the end of semester, I will review the works I have done in this semster and see what should I improve and prepare for next semester.
            Besides, I will make a summary of what I learned in this semester, and which one I'm interested in the most and why.
            I hope this page could be a recording and my profile.
